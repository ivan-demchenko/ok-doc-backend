### Docs Viewer Backend

This is an interactive backend for the docs viewer

The project provides the api for the docs viewer ui.

### How to run

```
npm install
npm run help
```

This project needs a config file which you can generate by running

```
npm run generate-config
```

However, if you have a config file already generated, you can run the api like this:

```
npm run api -c <path/to/config.json>
```

If you don't want any configs, then you can just use command line options listed in `help`
